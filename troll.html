"When I turned off the lights, I could still see a faint glow coming from the closet,",
"The air in the room changed, and I felt a chill run down my spine, but I was the only one there,",
"I woke up to find my bedroom filled with old toys I thought I had thrown away years ago,",
"My cat stared at the corner of the room, hissing at something I couldn’t see,",
"I heard someone softly calling my name from the bathroom, but the door was locked,",
"I was about to take a picture when I noticed the figure standing behind me in the lens reflection,",
"I keep finding dirty handprints on my windows, but I live on the second floor,",
"Every morning, I wake up to the sound of children laughing outside, but there are no children in my neighborhood,",

"I found an old diary that belonged to the previous owner of my house, and the last entry said, 'I’m still here,'",
"When I woke up, the figure from my dreams was standing at the foot of my bed, staring down at me,",
"I always thought the creaks in the floorboards were just the house settling, until they started mimicking my footsteps,",
"I was watching a horror movie when I heard a knock on my front door, but I live in a remote area,",
"I woke up to find my face smeared with blood, but I don’t remember anything from the night before,",
"I keep hearing the laughter of a child echoing in my empty house, but I haven’t had any visitors,",
"I glanced at my security camera footage, and there was someone standing at my front door for hours, staring at the camera,",
"I noticed a figure watching me from the woods every time I went out for a walk,",
"The lights flickered, and for a brief moment, I saw the silhouette of a person standing behind me,",
"When I turned on my computer, it was already logged in, with a document open that I never wrote,",
"I woke up in a cold sweat after dreaming of a place I’ve never been, only to find a photo of it on my wall the next morning,",
"I found a message carved into my bathroom mirror that read, 'I’ll be with you soon,' appearing every time I take a shower.",
